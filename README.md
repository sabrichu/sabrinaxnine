_[Sabrina x Nine](https://sabrinaxnine.com)_ is a web project created by Tamara Chu.

My father wanted to name me Sabrina, after the heroine of the Audrey Hepburn film; my mother wanted all her children to have names that start with the letter T. As a compromise, they decided to call me Sabrina, but only for two years.

We hide in our usernames and passwords parts of ourselves that don't seem to fit anywhere else: our childhood nicknames, our favorite song lyrics, our hopeful little beacons of identity. In this way Sabrina will always be mine, safely tucked away in a nonsensical email address; as though by disappearing at age 2, she transformed, like a dying mortal touched by divine mercy, into a tender white bunny shape-shifting in the underbrush, the grief of her unlived lives forever lifted.

## Thanks

Thank you to everyone whose feedback and encouragement buoyed me through years of on-and-off development: Blake Conway, Daniel Lucas, Drew Lopshire, Drew Ritter, Grayson Stebbins, Jeff Harris, Karen Hsu, and Monica Cuenca. And of course thank you to my parents, for setting a bizarre but successful example of marital negotiation.
